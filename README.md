Cook Systems Management Application
===============================
# Overview

For this group project, our team will work to write a full stack web application. The application will be managed in a simulated kan ban agile style and will make use of Github issues and the project board features. During the first day, we will go through the ERD and wireframe that the stakeholders had a account lead put together for you. From these each team will need to create their own endpoint documentation and add it to the wiki. Once that's done each team should meet with their lead and plan out the project by creating issues and assigning each member their first 2-3 tasks. The target for the week is to finish a minimum viable product of their application with as many features complete as possible and functional prototype to present to the full FT team and others from Cook Systems internal staff.
